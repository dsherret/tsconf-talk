# Tsconf Talk - Static Analysis and Source Code Manipulation

This was the code for my talk at [tsconf 2018](https://tsconf.io/).

* [slides.pptx](slides.pptx) - My slides.
* `npm run analyze` - Analyze the code. Finds all the classes with extends expressions.
* `npm run refactor` - Changes all the class declarations from `PascalCase` to `snake_case`.
